/* Linear Operator
 *
 * This is my attempt at some kind of bastardized linear operator struct.
 * The key weirdness here is that the operators track the rank of their inputs/outputs. Technically
 * a linear operator should only be applied to vectors and matrices, but within this context all of
 * those vectors represent higher-rank tensors that are for the purposes of the operator treated as
 * a vector.
 *
 * Hence here we track the input/output ranks.
